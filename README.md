Primeiro projeto usando Svelte.
Objetivo era mostrar alguns algoritmos em um App liso e responsivo.
Feito em um dia, Quebrei a cabe√ßa para conseguir fazer o deploy no Vercel, mas acabou dando certo :)
## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Speed Insights

Once deployed on Vercel, you can benefit from [Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/speed-insights) simply by navigating to Vercel's dashboard, clicking on the 'Speed Insights' tab, and enabling the product.

You will get data once your application will be re-deployed and will receive visitors.
